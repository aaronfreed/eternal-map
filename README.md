# eternal-map
Repository for *[Eternal X](https://eternal.bungie.org/)* 1.3’s split map folder. (*Eternal X* is a fan sequel to Bungie’s *[Marathon](https://alephone.lhowon.org)* trilogy that runs in the [Aleph One](https://alephone.lhowon.org/download.html) engine.)

> [!WARNING]
> **If this repository differs from the [Dropbox split map folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e40ip01je2y3bkj/AAD_RcywOdMZMox5Ss9IlAuKa), Dropbox should be considered more current.** I’ve mostly put this up to help the Japanese translators track our terminal revisions – GitHub’s commit history will likely help them out quite a lot.
